<p class="style1"><strong>FinDroid Help:</strong></p>
<p class="style3"><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p class="style3">FinDroid is a GPS and Messaging based phone finder 
application. This application will provide you great help in finding your lost 
phone. This application will provide you many facilities like the Map and the 
Radar views to get your lost phone back</p>
<p class="style3">NOTE: GPS has to be activated manually. No application has the 
authority to do so.</p>
<hr />
<p class="style3"><strong>Application Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style3">SEARCH A PHONE:</p>	
	<p class="style6">This button will let you get the GPS co-ordinates from the 
	lost phone by the means of messaging. You do not have to type the message, the 
	FinDroid will do so for you. This feature requires FinDroid to be installed on 
	the lost phone to communicate. After pressing this button the application will 
	ask for the lost phone&#39;s contact number and its FinDroid password. Please do 
	provide the details and press OK. This will send a message to the lost phone and 
	wait till the co-ordinates are re-lied back to us.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style3">Resume:</p>	
	<p class="style4">This menu button will launch the map view and the radar 
	view. The map view shows the lost phones location as well as your location. 
	It also has several options for navigating and ringing the phone from there 
	directly.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li class="style3">Change Pasword:</li>
</ul>
<p class="style7">Change the FinDroid password </p>
<ul>
	<li class="style3">Settings:</li>
</ul>
<p class="style7">Opens the preferences activity where you can customize the way 
you want this application to work.</p>
<hr />
<p class="style8"><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">Once FinDroid is activated, it will monitor incoming 
	messages for the keywords. (You can set keywords of your own choice for 
	alerting FinDroid)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">The keywords will tell FinDroid to perform specific 
	actions. They may be sending the GPS co-ordinates or ringing the phone.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">After confirming the keyword, FinDroid performs the 
	required action.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="style8"><strong>How does the search feature works?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">The search feature requires FinDroid installed on the lost 
	phone.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">On clicking the &#39;SEARCH A PHONE&#39; button, user should enter 
	the phone number and FinDroid password of the lost phone (The password is 
	required so that no unknown person can track your location).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">After entering the details, FinDroid will send an SMS to 
	the lost phone for getting the GPS co-ordinates. NOTE: The time taken by 
	FinDroid to get the GPS location may vary on different phones.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">The lost phone will then send you back the GPS 
	co-ordinates after confirming the password.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">On receiving the GPS co-ordinates, the FinDroid 
	application will provide you map and radar views to track your lost phone.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p class="style8"><strong>How does the sim card change detection works?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">Once this feature is activated, FinDroid will check for 
	unwanted sim card change on every boot.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">If the inserted sim card is not registered with FinDroid, 
	it will get the sim&#39;s info and the GPS location and will send it to the user 
	defined phone number</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style8">You can change the alert phone number and register sim 
	card in the settings.</p>
